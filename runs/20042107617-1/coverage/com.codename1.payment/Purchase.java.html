/**
 * Represents the status of in-app-purchase goods, this class provides information
 * about products purchased by a user as well as the ability to purchase additional
 * products. There are generally two types of payment systems: Manual and managed.
 * In manual payments we pay a specific amount in a specific currency  while with managed
 * payment systems we work against a product catalog defined in the server.
 * &lt;p&gt;In-app-purchase API's rely on managed server based products, other payment systems
 * use the manual approach. An application dealing with virtual goods must support both
 * since not all devices feature in-app-purchase API's. An application dealing with physical
 * goods &amp;amp; services must use the latter according to the TOS of current in-app-purchase
 * solutions.
